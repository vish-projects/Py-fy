* -> Must be done
** -> For future integration
# -> Is it useful ?

-------------------------------------
Tools to integrate at initial state:

- aircrack-ng
- Kismet
- Reaver
- ettercap/bettercap
- PixieWPS


--------------------------------------
Ask more people for tools they used on wifi assessments. Add to list for * || ** integration...

P.S All tools (well most of them) should come pre-installed with kali

*aircrack-ng -> P.S airoscript can help with creating commands for aircrack-ng and its set of tools (Basics !)
#Pyrit -> allows for creating of massive database of precomputed hashes
*Kismet -> 802.11 layer-2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system
*PixieWPS -> bruteforce offline the WPS pin exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some APs (pixie dust attack)
*Reaver -> implements a brute force attack against WPS registrar PINs in order to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases
*wifiphisher -> automates phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks in order to obtain credentials
*cowpatty -> Implementation of an offline dictionary attack against WPA/WPA2 networks using PSK-based authentication
*eapmd5pass -> This tool reads from a live network interface in monitor-mode, or from a stored libpcap capture file, and extracts the portions of the EAP-MD5 authentication exchange. eapmd5pass will mount an offline dictionary attack against the userâ€™s password
*blueranger -> bluetooth assessment tool
*packetforge-ng -> generate custom packets
*ettercap/bettercap ->  (either should the work !)
*wifitap -> Wifitap allows any application do send and receive IP packets using 802.11 traffic capture and injection over a WiFi networki

#Integrate routerpwn.com to find vulns about specific vendor

**Routersploit -> tries to find common vulnerabilities with routers
**SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) -> its a social engineering toolkit.. no need for more explanation
*Yersinia -> framework for performing layer 2 attacks. It is designed to take advantage of some weaknesses in different network protocols
*cisco-auditing-tool -> performs varies methods to audit cisco routers
*cisco-torch -> Cisco Torch mass scanning, fingerprinting, and exploitation tool
**cisco-ocs -> A mass Cisco scanning tool
*cisco-global-exploiter -> tries to find vulns with cisco routers

(Website)
**Integrate exploit-db to find exploits for routers

*copy-router-config -> attempts to get config file of cisco routers
**Redfang -> application to find non discoverable Bluetooth devices
*wpaclean -> clean .cap files, get only handshake and beacon
**wlan2eth -> rewrite 802.11 packets to standard ethernet frames
**rfdump -> detect RFID-tags and show their meta information
#airpwn -> create generic packets for 802.11 to perform injection
**airgeddon -> This is a multi-use bash script for Linux systems to audit wireless networks
**aphopper -> tool to auto hop between access points
**dnsmasq -> setup a dhcp or dns caching server on the attacker box to log traffic from an EvilTwin attack
#iptables -> integrate IPTables for later use with dnsmasq. Configure firewall to allow certain methods of traffic (Drop|Allow|Block -> Incomming|Outgoing Traffic)

Could prob use iwconfig to manually set adapters in monitor mode ?...
